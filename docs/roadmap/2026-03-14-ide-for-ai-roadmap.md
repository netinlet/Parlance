# IDE for AI: Roadmap

## Vision

Parlance is the **IDE for the AI agent**. Developer tooling is a side-effect.

The differentiator is not raw Roslyn (6+ MCP servers already do that). It's **opinionated judgment on top of Roslyn** — curation, scoring, fix safety classification, idiomatic direction. SonarQube is a judge. Raw Roslyn MCP servers are compilers-via-API. Parlance is an opinionated senior developer via MCP.

The primary consumer is the AI agent (Claude). The primary feedback loop is dogfooding: Claude uses Parlance's MCP tools while building Parlance. What works and what's missing drives what gets built next.

## Architectural North Star

**The engine holds the full Roslyn workspace internally; tools are just views into it.**

```
CSharpWorkspaceSession (MSBuildWorkspace, Compilation, SemanticModel)
    ↑
MCP Server (primary interface, long-running, stdio + HTTP/SSE)
    ├── Semantic Navigation Tools (describe-type, find-implementations, ...)
    ├── Diagnostic Tools (analyze, fix)
    └── Workspace Tools (workspace-status, rules)
    ↑
CLI (thin client, report mode, one-shot)
```

The C# engine wraps `MSBuildWorkspace` and owns the full `Workspace` → `Solution` → `Project` → `Compilation` → `SemanticModel` graph. Callers never touch Roslyn directly. The public API surface reflects only what is implemented — no stubs, no `NotImplementedException` placeholders.

### Multi-Language Architecture

**Normalize outputs, not internals.** Mature multi-language systems (SonarQube, CodeQL, Semgrep) unify the host, workflow, and result model. They keep compilation, caching, and program semantics inside each language engine.

- **Parlance.Abstractions** owns the normalized result model (`Diagnostic`, `Location`, `AnalysisResult`) — language-neutral.
- **Parlance.CSharp.Workspace** owns everything C#/Roslyn-specific: MSBuild loading, compilation, semantic model, caching, project identity.
- **The host/engine boundary** will be designed in Milestone 2 when the MCP server is built. Designing the plugin interface before building the host leads to speculative abstractions that leak implementation concepts.

The honest split:
- **Shared (future):** session lifecycle, snapshot identity, health, normalized diagnostics, capability signaling
- **Language-specific:** workspace loading, build/program creation, semantic model access, invalidation, caching, fix application mechanics

#### Why C#-first, not multi-language now

The current roadmap is deeply Roslyn-shaped: real MSBuildWorkspace, semantic navigation, analyzer execution over real compilations, hot server mode. These are C# goals, not generic workspace goals.

Designing a multi-language abstraction now leads to one of two bad outcomes: a dishonest generic interface that really means "C# workspace," or a least-common-denominator interface too weak to be useful. C#-first ships working product value without lying about the abstraction boundary.

#### What multi-language would look like (deferred to second language)

When a second language is added, the shared layer describes sessions and capabilities — not compiler internals:

```csharp
public interface IWorkspaceSession : IAsyncDisposable
{
    WorkspaceSessionId Id { get; }
    string RootPath { get; }
    long SnapshotVersion { get; }
    WorkspaceCapabilities Capabilities { get; }
    WorkspaceHealth Health { get; }
    IReadOnlyList<WorkspaceUnit> Units { get; }
    Task RefreshAsync(CancellationToken ct = default);
}

public interface ILanguageWorkspaceAdapter
{
    string Language { get; }
    bool CanOpen(WorkspaceOpenRequest request);
    Task<IWorkspaceSession> OpenAsync(WorkspaceOpenRequest request, CancellationToken ct = default);
}
```

Key design principles for the multi-language layer:

- **Snapshot semantics are shared; invalidation mechanics are not.** Every session has a `SnapshotVersion`. How freshness is maintained is adapter-specific (C# uses file watching + per-project invalidation; TypeScript might rebuild on every change; syntax-only engines might just re-read files).
- **Capability-based query surfaces.** The MCP host lights up tools based on `WorkspaceCapabilities` — `describe-type` only when `SupportsSemanticNavigation` is true, `preview-fix` only when `SupportsFixes` is true. Not every language answers the same semantic questions.
- **Language-specific operations stay behind language-specific services.** Common diagnostics output and session lifecycle can be shared. Compilation, semantic model access, caching — those stay inside the engine.

Migration path:

1. Keep the existing C# engine intact
2. Introduce a host-level `IWorkspaceSession` in Abstractions
3. Wrap `CSharpWorkspaceSession` in a C# adapter
4. Add a second adapter for the new language
5. Move only truly shared concepts into the shared layer

## Two Modes

- **Server mode** (Milestones 2-4): Long-running process, hot workspace, MCP interface. Immediate feedback while coding. File watching keeps the workspace current.
- **Report mode** (Milestone 5): One-shot — load, analyze, output, exit. For CI, quality gates, SonarQube-style reports. The CLI `analyze` command becomes this.

Same engine, same analyzers, different lifecycle. Mode is selected via `WorkspaceOpenOptions` at session creation.

## Dependency Graph

```
Milestone 1 (C# Workspace Engine)
  └── Milestone 2 (MCP Server + host/engine boundary design)
        ├── Milestone 3 (Semantic Navigation) ← priority: helps build everything after
        │     └── Milestone 6 (Code Actions) ← read-write tools, depends on semantic nav
        ├── Milestone 4 (Diagnostics over MCP)
        └── Milestone 7 (Test & Verification) ← closes the feedback loop
  Milestone 5 (CLI Pivot) ← last, uses same engine
```

Milestones 3 and 4 are parallel branches off the MCP server. Semantic navigation is prioritized because those tools help Claude build the diagnostic layer more effectively. Milestone 6 (Code Actions) builds on the workspace navigation from M3 to apply source transformations. Milestone 7 (Test & Verification) closes the feedback loop — Claude can verify changes compile, pass tests, and maintain coverage. Milestone 5 depends on Milestone 1 (workspace engine) and Milestone 4 (diagnostic model) but is last priority.

## Curation Sets

Curation sets are named, opinionated selections of rules from any source (NetAnalyzers, Roslynator, PARL, future packages) with:

- Which rules are in/out
- Severity overrides
- Rationale and fix classification

**Default**: "What the project already says." Respect `AnalysisLevel`, `.editorconfig`, `NoWarn`. Zero Parlance opinions unless a named set is applied.

**Named sets** layer on top of the project default. Example: `ai-agent` (tuned for validating AI-generated code), `modern-csharp`, `security`, `minimal`.

Curation set definitions are a product design exercise as much as engineering. They evolve continuously through dogfooding and have no "done" state. They are tracked via a pinned tracking issue and `curation` label, not a milestone.

PARL analyzers are trimmed to 1 stub rule as part of Milestone 4. Until then, the existing 8 rules remain but are not a development focus. They are loaded identically to any 3rd party analyzer package — no special code path. Value comes from curating 3rd party analyzers.

## Key Decisions

- **MSBuildWorkspace from day one.** This is a pivot, not incremental. The synthetic compilation approach is replaced.
- **C#-first, honestly.** No speculative multi-language abstractions. The host/engine boundary is designed when the host (MCP server) is built.
- **MCP server is the primary interface.** CLI becomes a thin client.
- **Semantic navigation before diagnostics.** Build the tools that make Claude better at coding, then use them to build the diagnostic layer.
- **File watching is on by default in server mode.** Stale compilations produce wrong diagnostics. Can be disabled for testing/debugging if callers use `RefreshAsync()` for manual updates.
- **No stale reads.** Per-project dirty tracking with dependency-aware cascade. Reads validate freshness before serving. Snapshot version on the session for staleness detection.
- **Lazy project compilation.** Load the project graph eagerly, compile on demand. Design for large solutions.
- **Pluggable transport.** stdio (Claude Code) + HTTP/SSE (future clients). Day one.
- **Logging day one.** `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`, structured, throughout.
- **Curation sets are code-defined.** `.editorconfig` is an output, not an input. (Note: earlier design docs used the term "profiles" — "curation sets" supersedes that terminology.)
- **No public stubs.** API surface reflects actual capability. Methods added when implemented.

## Risks and Technical Uncertainty

**MSBuildWorkspace is the highest-risk work in this roadmap.** It is notoriously difficult to get working correctly: MSBuild locator issues, SDK resolution, cross-platform behavior, NuGet restore interactions, and handling partially broken projects. Milestone 1 should be approached expecting friction, not treating it as routine plumbing. Known pitfalls include MSBuild version conflicts, `Microsoft.Build.Locator` needing to run before any MSBuild types are loaded, and workspace diagnostic events that must be monitored for silent failures.

**Existing tests (120+) rely on the current architecture.** The synthetic compilation engine isn't deleted immediately — it's replaced milestone by milestone. Tests migrate as their corresponding engine components are replaced. No big-bang cutover.

## Project Structure

`Parlance.CSharp.Workspace` is a new project that sits below `Parlance.CSharp` in the dependency graph:

```
Parlance.Abstractions              (Diagnostic, Location, AnalysisResult — unchanged)
    ↑
Parlance.CSharp.Workspace          (NEW — CSharpWorkspaceSession, C#/Roslyn engine)
    ↑
Parlance.CSharp                    (analysis engine — evolves to use workspace engine)
    ↑
Parlance.Analyzers.Upstream        (analyzer loading — evolves to be the only loading path)
    ↑
Parlance.Mcp                      (NEW — MCP server, host/engine boundary designed here)
Parlance.Cli                      (thin client — refactored in Milestone 5)
```

## Not in Scope (Future Work)

These capabilities from the research document are intentionally deferred. They may become issues later based on dogfooding:

- `type-check` — Verify an expression resolves correctly without a full build
- `check-impact` — "If I change this signature, what breaks?"
- `validate-pattern` — "Is this async/dispose/nullable pattern correct?"
- `refactor-preview` / `refactor-apply` — Preview and apply refactorings with impact assessment
- `generate-boilerplate` — Compiler-correct IDisposable, equality, etc.
- `trace-data-flow` — How does a value flow through the code?
- `find-similar` — Semantic similarity search across the codebase
- **Structural change detection** — Detect added/removed files, `.csproj` edits, `Directory.Build.props` changes, NuGet restore/reference changes without requiring session rebuild. Milestone 1 only handles source text changes to existing documents.

## GitHub Project Setup

- **One Kanban board** with columns: `Backlog` → `Up Next` → `In Progress` → `Done`
- **Milestones** for major deliverables (each groups related issues)
- **Labels** for area tagging: `engine`, `mcp`, `tools`, `curation`, `cli`
- **Curation sets**: Pinned tracking issue + `curation` label (no milestone — ongoing work). Path to separate board if it outgrows the main one.

## Milestone 1: C# Workspace Engine

Foundation. Replaces synthetic `CompilationFactory` with real `MSBuildWorkspace` via `CSharpWorkspaceSession`.

### Key types (from design spec)

- `CSharpWorkspaceSession` — sealed class wrapping MSBuildWorkspace, static factories, `IAsyncDisposable`
- `WorkspaceOpenOptions` — mode, file watching, logging configuration
- `WorkspaceMode` — `Report` (one-shot) or `Server` (long-running)
- `CSharpWorkspaceHealth` — overall status with per-project details
- `CSharpProjectInfo` — project metadata, status, and diagnostics inline
- `WorkspaceProjectKey` — strongly typed project identity (avoids Roslyn `ProjectId` collision)
- `WorkspaceLoadStatus` — `Loaded`, `Degraded`, `Failed`
- `SnapshotVersion` — monotonic counter for staleness detection

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-14-parlance-workspace-design.md` for full API design.

### Issues

#### 1. Create `Parlance.CSharp.Workspace` project and design API

New project: `Parlance.CSharp.Workspace` (net10.0). Add `Microsoft.Build.Locator`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces`. Implement the `CSharpWorkspaceSession` type with loading and health API. No stubs — only implemented surface is public.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Project builds with MSBuild dependencies resolved
- Core type compiles with the designed API surface
- API design self-evident from the type signatures
- Existing tests continue to pass

#### 2. Implement solution/project loading

Load `.sln` via `OpenSolutionAsync()`, `.csproj` via `OpenProjectAsync()`. Resolve NuGet references, project references, target frameworks. Error boundaries: one project failing produces `Degraded` status, not a crash.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Loads `Parlance.sln` successfully
- Reports all projects with `CSharpProjectInfo` (status, TFM, diagnostics)
- A broken project reference produces `Degraded` health, not a crash
- Integration test confirms loading

#### 3. Workspace health reporting

`CSharpWorkspaceHealth` with per-project `CSharpProjectInfo`. Three-state model: `Loaded`, `Degraded`, `Failed`. Structured `WorkspaceDiagnostic` messages for load failures. `WorkspaceLoadException` for total failures.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Health report for `Parlance.sln` shows all projects, TFMs, language versions
- Failed projects reported with structured diagnostics, not swallowed
- `Degraded` status when some but not all projects fail

#### 4. File watching and incremental updates

`FileSystemWatcher` on loaded project directories. On file change, update workspace via `WithDocumentText()` — not full reload. Debounce rapid changes. Mark affected projects dirty. Increment `SnapshotVersion`.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Modify a `.cs` file, workspace reflects the change without full reload
- Rapid saves don't cause thrashing
- `SnapshotVersion` increments on change

#### 5. Compilation cache with per-project dirtiness

Internal `IProjectCompilationCache` — selected by `WorkspaceMode`. Per-project dirty tracking with dependency-aware cascade via Roslyn's `ProjectDependencyGraph`. Reads validate per-project freshness before serving. Hard guarantee: a read never returns stale data.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Loading a solution does not compile all projects upfront
- First query against a project triggers compilation
- Subsequent queries use cached compilation
- File change marks the right projects dirty (including dependents)
- Concurrent queries to different projects don't block each other

#### 6. Structured logging for workspace operations

`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` via `ILoggerFactory` in `WorkspaceOpenOptions`. Log: load start/complete, project load, file change, compilation, errors. Configurable sinks.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Loading a solution produces structured log output
- Log levels are appropriate (info for lifecycle, debug for details, error for failures)

---

## Milestone 2: First MCP Tool Working

MCP server starts, loads workspace, Claude can query it. **This is where the host/engine boundary is designed** — the MCP server is the host, `CSharpWorkspaceSession` is the first engine. The shared `IWorkspaceSession` interface (or equivalent) in Abstractions emerges from what the host actually needs.

### Issues

#### 7. Create `Parlance.Mcp` project

New project with `ModelContextProtocol` SDK. Transport architecture is pluggable from the start. Implement stdio transport first (required for Claude Code). HTTP/SSE transport is deferred to a future issue but the design should not preclude it. Server lifecycle: startup, graceful shutdown, configuration (solution path, log level, transport).

**I/O and transport evaluation:** Before committing to the `ModelContextProtocol` SDK's built-in transport, evaluate the underlying I/O model. The server must perform well cross-platform (Linux/WSL2 + Windows). Considerations:
- What does the MCP SDK use under the hood? Is it `System.IO.Pipelines` or raw streams?
- For stdio: `PipeReader`/`PipeWriter` over `Console.OpenStandardInput/Output` is the performant path
- For HTTP/SSE (future): Kestrel abstracts over epoll (Linux) / IOCP (Windows) / kqueue (macOS) automatically
- Can we swap the I/O layer if the SDK's default isn't sufficient, or do we need to bring our own transport?

Document the evaluation findings before building on top.

**Labels:** `mcp`

**Acceptance:**
- Project builds
- I/O model evaluated and documented (SDK capabilities, cross-platform behavior, performance characteristics)
- Server starts and accepts connections via stdio
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Transport abstraction allows adding HTTP/SSE later without restructuring

#### 8. Wire workspace engine into MCP server and design host/engine boundary

MCP server loads `CSharpWorkspaceSession` on startup (configurable solution path). **Design the shared `IWorkspaceSession` or equivalent interface in Abstractions** based on what the host actually needs — session identity, health, snapshot version, capability queries. The C# engine is wrapped in an adapter. This is the seam where a future language engine plugs in.

The engine's file watcher keeps the workspace current — the MCP layer queries the engine's current state on each tool call (no caching at the MCP level that could go stale).

**Labels:** `mcp`, `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Server starts, loads configured solution
- Workspace health is available to tool handlers
- Load failure is reported, not crashed
- File changes are reflected in subsequent tool calls without server restart
- Host/engine interface documented and implemented

#### 9. Implement `workspace-status` tool and end-to-end verification

First MCP tool. Returns: loaded projects, health, TFMs, language versions, project dependency graph. Shaped for LLM consumption — compact, structured, actionable. Includes end-to-end verification: configure as Claude Code MCP server, verify Claude can invoke the tool, document setup.

**Labels:** `mcp`, `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Claude can call `workspace-status` and get a useful response
- Response fits comfortably in a context window
- Includes project count, health summary, any load failures
- Claude Code MCP server configuration documented in repo
- Claude invokes the tool successfully end-to-end

#### 10. Structured logging for MCP operations

Request/response logging, error logging, performance timing. Same logging infrastructure as the engine.

**Labels:** `mcp`

**Acceptance:**
- Each MCP tool call logged with timing
- Errors logged with context
- Log output doesn't interfere with stdio transport

---

## Milestone 3: Semantic Navigation Usable

Claude can query types, find implementations, trace references. Force multiplier for all subsequent work.

### Issues

#### 11. Implement `describe-type` tool

Given a type name, resolve via workspace semantic model. Return: members, base types, interfaces, attributes, accessibility. Filtered to what matters — not a raw 200-member dump. Handle ambiguity (multiple types with same name across projects).

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `describe-type IAnalysisEngine` returns members, implemented by, namespace
- `describe-type Diagnostic` returns record members, base type
- Ambiguous names return candidates with project context

#### 12. Implement `find-implementations` tool

Given interface or abstract type name, find all implementations across the solution. Return: implementing type, project, file location.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `find-implementations IAnalysisEngine` returns `CSharpAnalysisEngine`
- Works for interfaces and abstract classes
- Results include file paths and project names

#### 13. Implement `find-references` tool

Given a symbol name, find all usages across the solution. Grouped by project/file. Handle overloads (let caller specify which overload or return all).

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `find-references CompilationFactory.Create` returns all call sites
- Results grouped by file with line numbers
- Handles methods, types, properties

#### 14. Implement `get-type-at` tool

Given a file path and line/column (or expression text), resolve the actual type. The `var` resolver. Also resolves generic type arguments, return types, parameter types.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Points at `var engine = new CSharpAnalysisEngine(...)` → reports `CSharpAnalysisEngine`
- Resolves generic types: `IReadOnlyList<Diagnostic>`
- Reports nullability state

#### 15. LLM output shaping for semantic tools

Ensure all semantic tool outputs are compact, structured, and actionable for an LLM context window. Iterate based on dogfooding. Consistent format across tools.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Response format documented
- No tool response exceeds reasonable context budget for its query
- Format is consistent across all semantic tools

#### 16. Implement `outline-file` tool

Given a file path, return the type/member skeleton: types, methods, properties, fields with accessibility and signatures. No method bodies — skeleton only. Lets Claude understand a large file's shape without reading every line.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `outline-file src/Parlance.CSharp/CSharpAnalysisEngine.cs` returns type names and member signatures
- Output is compact — no method bodies, no trivial auto-property implementations
- Handles files with multiple types

#### 17. Implement `get-symbol-docs` tool

Given a fully qualified symbol name, return its XML documentation comments. Resolves inherited docs and `<see cref>` references. Returns structured output (summary, params, returns, remarks) not raw XML. Lets Claude understand APIs without reading source.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `get-symbol-docs Parlance.Abstractions.IAnalysisEngine` returns summary and member docs
- Structured output: summary, params, returns, remarks
- Graceful fallback when no docs exist

#### 18. Implement `call-hierarchy` tool

Given a method name, return its callers (incoming) and callees (outgoing) one level deep. Structured as a tree, not a flat list. Helps Claude understand impact before modifying a method. Companion to `find-references` — where that returns all symbol usages, this returns the call graph shape.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `call-hierarchy CSharpAnalysisEngine.AnalyzeAsync` returns all direct callers with file/line
- Outgoing calls (what this method calls) also returned
- Handles overloads — caller specifies which or gets all

#### 19. Implement `get-type-dependencies` tool

Given a type name, return what it depends on (base types, interfaces, field types, method parameter/return types) and what depends on it (types that reference it). One level of the dependency graph. Helps Claude understand blast radius before modifying a type.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `get-type-dependencies CSharpWorkspaceSession` returns dependencies and dependents grouped by relationship kind
- Dependents: types that have fields/parameters/returns of this type
- Scoped to the solution — does not enumerate framework types

#### 20. Implement `safe-to-delete` tool

Predicate: is this symbol referenced anywhere in the solution? Returns boolean + reference count + representative sample locations. Essentially `find-references` with a structured summary for the "is this dead?" question. Lets Claude verify a symbol is unused before removing it.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `safe-to-delete CompilationFactory` returns false with reference list
- `safe-to-delete` on an unused private method returns true
- Works for types, methods, properties, fields

#### 21. Implement `decompile-type` tool

Given an external type name (from a referenced assembly), decompile and return its C# source using ICSharpCode.Decompiler. Lets Claude understand external APIs without source access — the single most uniquely valuable capability an AI agent cannot replicate via CLI.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `decompile-type Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Project` returns readable decompiled C#
- Output is valid C# (not IL)
- Graceful failure when type not found in any referenced assembly

---

## Milestone 4: Diagnostics over MCP

Run analyzers against workspace compilations, return curated diagnostics.

### Issues

#### 22. Unify analyzer loading

All analyzers (PARL stub + NetAnalyzers + Roslynator + future packages) loaded through one path. No special-casing for PARL. Trim PARL rules to 1 stub to keep the project alive.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Single loader loads all analyzer DLLs
- PARL has 1 stub rule
- Loader reports what it found

#### 23. Wire analyzers into workspace compilation

Run loaded analyzers against real workspace compilations via `WithAnalyzers()`. Map Roslyn diagnostics to Parlance output model.

**Labels:** `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- Analyzers run against workspace compilation (not synthetic)
- Diagnostics mapped to Parlance types with metadata
- Analyzer failure doesn't crash the engine

#### 24. Implement `analyze` tool

MCP tool: run diagnostics on a file, project, or solution scope. Returns curated diagnostics with fix classification (auto-fixable / needs-review / info-only). Dead code (IDE0051, IDE0052, RCS1213, etc.) and duplicate code are diagnostic rule categories that flow through this tool — not separate tools. Curation sets control which categories are active.

**Labels:** `mcp`, `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `analyze` on a file returns diagnostics from workspace compilation
- Each diagnostic includes: rule ID, severity, message, location, fix classification
- Scoping works: file, project, solution

#### 25. Diagnostic output model for LLMs

Design the diagnostic response format: structured, compact, actionable. Rationale, fix suggestions, severity, source rule. This is the shared contract for MCP and future CLI.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Format documented
- Includes enough context to act on (file, location, message, fix suggestion)
- Compact enough for batch results (20+ diagnostics don't blow up context)

---

## Milestone 5: CLI Pivot

CLI becomes a thin client over the workspace engine. Report mode for CI and quality gates.

### Issues

#### 26. Refactor CLI to use workspace engine

Replace synthetic compilation with `CSharpWorkspaceSession` from Milestone 1. `analyze`, `fix`, `rules` commands all use the new engine with `WorkspaceMode.Report`.

**Labels:** `cli`, `engine`

**Acceptance:**
- `parlance analyze` uses MSBuildWorkspace, not CompilationFactory
- Output is equivalent or better than current
- Existing CLI tests pass (updated as needed)

#### 27. Report mode: one-shot analysis

Load workspace, run analysis, output, exit. Optimized for CI — no file watching, no hot workspace. Fast startup, clean exit with appropriate exit code.

**Labels:** `cli`

**Acceptance:**
- `parlance analyze --report` (or equivalent) runs one-shot
- Exit code reflects pass/fail threshold
- Works in CI without a long-running process

#### 28. Machine-readable output formats

JSON output (already exists, update for new model). Consider SARIF for CI tool integration. Human-readable text output updated.

**Labels:** `cli`

**Acceptance:**
- JSON output matches new diagnostic model
- Text output is clean and useful
- SARIF output parseable by standard CI tools (if implemented)

---

## Milestone 6: Code Actions

Apply workspace-level source transformations via MCP. These are read-write tools — the engine validates safety before applying. All actions support a preview mode that returns proposed changes without writing files.

### Issues

#### 29. Implement `rename-symbol` action

Solution-wide rename via Roslyn's `Renamer.RenameSymbolAsync`. Validates the new name doesn't conflict, previews the changeset, applies across all files. Avoids Claude doing manual find/replace across N files with inevitable misses.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `rename-symbol CompilationFactory NewName` renames across all files in the solution
- Preview mode returns proposed file changes without applying
- Conflict detection: reports if new name collides in scope
- Works for types, methods, properties, fields, parameters

#### 30. Implement `extract-method` action

Given a file, start line, and end line, extract the selected statements into a new method. Uses Roslyn's Extract Method code action. Correctly infers parameters, return type, and placement.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Extracts a code block into a named method with correct signature
- Preview mode available
- Reports failure clearly when selection is not extractable (e.g., multiple return paths)

#### 31. Implement `inline-symbol` action

Inline a variable or field — replace all usages with the definition and remove the declaration. Validates no side effects before inlining.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Inlines a single-use variable correctly
- Refuses to inline when side effects are detected
- Preview mode available

---

## Milestone 7: Test & Verification

Close the feedback loop. Claude can verify its changes compile, pass tests, and maintain coverage — without leaving the MCP interface.

### Issues

#### 32. Implement `run-tests` tool

Discover test projects from the workspace (by framework reference: xUnit, NUnit, MSTest), run selected or all tests, return structured results. Uses `dotnet test` under the hood but is workspace-aware — Claude doesn't need to know project paths.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- `run-tests` discovers and runs all test projects
- `run-tests --project Parlance.CSharp.Tests` runs one project
- `run-tests --filter "Analyze_SingleFile"` runs matching tests
- Structured results: pass/fail/skip counts, failed test names, failure messages, duration
- Coverage output via Coverlet: line coverage percentage per file

#### 33. Implement `resolve-stacktrace` tool

Given raw .NET stack trace text (from a test failure, exception log, or crash), resolve each frame to source file + line number using workspace symbol information. Returns structured frames Claude can navigate to directly.

**Labels:** `tools`

**Acceptance:**
- Paste a .NET stack trace, get back `[{ method, file, line, column }]`
- Handles async stack traces (unwraps state machine generated frames)
- Graceful fallback for frames from external assemblies (marks as unresolvable, includes assembly name)
- Works with both exception stack traces and test failure output

---

## Curation Sets (ongoing, no milestone)

Tracked via pinned tracking issue + `curation` label on individual issues.

**Tracking issue description:**

> Curation sets are named, opinionated selections of analyzer rules. This is ongoing product design work — no "done" state. Each curation task (add a rule, tune a severity, define a new set) is its own issue labeled `curation`.
>
> **Infrastructure:** Built as a curation issue (see "Curation set infrastructure" below), prerequisite for Milestone 4's `analyze` tool.
> **Default set:** "What the project says" — respect project configuration, zero Parlance opinions.
> **Named sets:** Layer on top of defaults. First set: `ai-agent`, informed by dogfooding.

### Initial curation issues (created as needed):

#### Curation set infrastructure
Define sets in code, apply/layer/override mechanism. A curation set specifies rule selections, severity overrides, and metadata. Sets layer on top of project defaults. **Labels:** `curation`, `engine`. **Acceptance:** A curation set can be defined in code and applied to filter/override analyzer output. Sets compose (project default + named set).

#### Default curation set
"What the project says." Respect `AnalysisLevel`, `.editorconfig`, `NoWarn` from the loaded workspace. Zero Parlance opinions. **Labels:** `curation`. **Acceptance:** With no named set applied, diagnostic output matches what `dotnet build` would produce.

#### `ai-agent` curation set v1
First named set, tuned for validating AI-generated code. Built from dogfooding observations — what does Claude actually get wrong? **Labels:** `curation`. **Acceptance:** Set defined with at least 10 curated rules. Rationale documented for each rule inclusion.

#### Curation set selection via MCP
`analyze` tool accepts optional curation set parameter. `rules` tool shows what's active in the current set. **Labels:** `curation`, `mcp`. **Acceptance:** Claude can pass a curation set name to `analyze` and get filtered results. Default behavior (no set specified) uses project defaults.

## What Gets Replaced

The pivot replaces several components of the current architecture:

| Current | Replaced by | When |
|---|---|---|

## What Stays

- Upstream analyzer loader concept (NetAnalyzers, Roslynator) — evolved to be the only loading path
- `DiagnosticEnricher` — evolved for workspace-based diagnostics
- Scoring model — evolved after curation sets exist
- System.CommandLine 2.0.3 CLI structure — refactored, not replaced
- xUnit test infrastructure
- Real-world test repos and `test-repos.sh`
